# cupcake_sales_analyzer
This program analyzes monthly cupcake sales data from a file. It calculates total, average, median, and mode sales, identifies the months with the highest and lowest sales, sorts the data, and displays a histogram. Developed for CSC150 at SDSU under Ms. Kurtenbach, it demonstrates file handling, array manipulation, and statistical computations.
